Fill My List
==============

FML proxies to several different web services (UTS eResearch has added lookups to SCOT, Geonames and Library of Congress to use with Omeka) with a consistent syntax to return key-value pairs for suggestion drop downs to text entry fields.

Also see Omeka plugin ozmeka/SuggestAnything which calls this as a service.

May eventually be repackaged as an Omeka plugin.
